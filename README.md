# Minefield

Just a clone of Minesweeper. Nothing to see here. **\*WIP\***

I made this originally about a year ago, using some put together MVC pattern and the super neat `Object.observe()` function which unfortunately doesn't work anymore. Decided to revive this one because you can never have enough clones of classic games, and also perhaps to have a simple project on which to test the Redux framework.

Other than Redux I also experiment here with only using assigned function expressions, as well as ES6 imports/exports which I have previously eschewed in favor of simpler and, in some ways, more powerful `require()` functions.
